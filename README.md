This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# The website is hosted on vercel to redirect to the website click <a href="https://landing-page-gdse-submission.vercel.app/">here<a>
<ul>
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open the link provided on the top right corner of the map with your browser to see the site hosted on Vercel.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
